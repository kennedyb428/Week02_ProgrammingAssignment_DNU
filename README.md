Week #2 Programming Assignment by Brittany Kennedy

Vegetarian Nutrition for Weightlifting is a C++ program designed to help vegetarian weightlifters calculate their macronutrient goals (protein, carbohydrates, and fats) based on their calorie target and number of meals per day.

The program guides the user through a few questions, performs the necessary calculations, and outputs a report both to the console window and a text file (report.txt) for easy reference or printing.

The features of this program are as follows:

   1. Calculates macros using input from the user and the following ratios:
        a. 30% Protein
        b. 40% Carbohydrates
        c. 30% Fats
  2. Converts calories to grams for each macronutrient
  3. Divides total macros across the userâ€™s chosen number of meals
  4. Displays and saves results in a readable format
  5. Includes positive, motivational messages for user engagement
